<title>Zonai Script</title>
<h1>Zonai Script<br><small>from Nintendo's Tears of the Kingdom</small></h1>

This website is a collection of samples and notes on the use of the Zonai
writing system in Tears of the Kingdom.

<h2>Structure</h2>
Zonai script is written using only 14 symbols:

<p class=zonai style="font-size: 36px; text-align: center;">
	B C D H J L M N R S T U W Y
</p>

The game uses a handful of other
symbols in the Zonai "language", such as those associated with the summonable
champions, but they don't appear in larger passages. These are explicitly
Japanese kanji. For example, the Yunobo summon symbol is a variant of "炎",
meaning "flames".

<p>The text is usually written in vertical columns, but is sometimes written in
rings. Less commonly, it is written in rows.

<p>I suspect that circular text is usually read counter-clockwise. For example,
	consider the circular writing on the back of the Zonai stake:

<div class="display-zonai" data-display-zonai-title="devices/stake/back"></div>

<p>If you read it clockwise, you get <span class=zonai>HSLJ</span>.
<p>If you read it counter-clockwise, you get <span class=zonai>HJLS</span>.

<p>Now consider some of the other zonai devices:

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
	<div class="display-zonai" data-display-zonai-title="devices/sled"></div>
	<div class="display-zonai" data-display-zonai-title="devices/flame"></div>
	<div class="display-zonai" data-display-zonai-title="devices/hydrant"></div>
	<div class="display-zonai" data-display-zonai-title="devices/tank"></div>
</div>

<p>These all have the same string <span class=zonai>HJL(S)</span>, which matches
	the <strong>counter-clockwise</strong> reading.

<ul>
	<li>The stake has a small bit of circular writing on it.
	<li>Read clockwise, it would be <span class=zonai>HSLJ</span>.
	<li>Read counter-clockwise, it would be <span class=zonai>HJLS</span>.
	<li>Both the flame emitter and the sled have the same string
		<span class=zonai>HJL(SY)</span>, which is why I suspect the
		counter-clockwise reading.
</ul>

<p>The text has a visual similarity to CJK logographs, especially
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone_script">
	oracle bone script
</a>. As mentioned above, a handful of other symbols like those associated with
the champions are very clearly derivatives of Japanese kanji.

<p>Previous installments in the Zelda franchise have created Hylian scripts
which were simple ciphers for English or Japanese text. Recent games (including
<i>Breath of the Wild</i>'s Sheikah script) have been English ciphers, but
several factors point to this script rather being a cipher for Japanese:

<ul>
	<li>The script has a basic resemblance to old Chinese/Japanese writing
	<li>Like classical Japanese, the script is written in columns
	<li>14 symbols is far too few to write intelligible English text
	<li>Japanese is normally written in a syllabary of 45 symbols formed from
		5 vowels and 9 consonants (plus several voicing marks)
		<ul>
			<li>Using voicing marks is a convention in modern Japanese; texts
				older than around 1850 wouldn't have used them regularly, making
				it appropriate that an "ancient" language based on Japanese
				wouldn't use them.
		</ul>
</ul>

<section id="letter-frequency">
	<h2>Letter Frequency</h2>
	Some of the "letters" appear much more than others:
</section>

<section id="bigram-frequency">
	<h2>Bigram Frequency</h2>
	<p>Some combinations of letters appear much more frequently.
	<p>There is not a clear resemblance to romaji's bigram frequencies, but
		because there is so little sample data, and it likely contains many
		transcription errors or oddities, it is hard to compare.
	<p>A less plausible explanation may be that the text is not an alphabet,
		but an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad">abjad</a>; there
		are also 14 consonants in Japanese: 
		(K, G; S, Z; T, D; H, B, P; R, M, N, Y, W).<br>
		However, this would be nearly unreadable, so I don't suspect this is
		the case. Many grammatical functions are indicated solely using vowels,
		which makes this a terribly unclear way to write Japanese.<br>
	<p>I <em>do</em> think that some of the text in the game is nonsense; in
		particular, the stone tablets in the Ring Ruins should be a trove of
		Zonai text, since each tablet contains 54 letters.
	<p>However, the letter distribution in them is as-uniform-as-possible, which
		makes me think they are random rather than actual text. It's possible
		that other garbage samples exist in the game, but since many of them
		are so short, it is hard to separate them.

<section id="trigram-frequency" style="display: none">
	<h2>Trigram Frequency</h2>
	<p>Certain "phrases" are repeated between many different texts.

<section id="word-starts">
	<h2>Word Starts</h2>
	<p>Due to the relatively rigid structure of Japanese syllables, certain
		letters are much more likely to begin a sentence or phrase.
	<p>This may be a useful starting point for identifying vowels and
		consonants.

<h2>Technical Details</h2>
I used the free version of
<a href="https://www.calligraphr.com/en/">Calligraphr</a> to create a custom TTF
font to encode the 14 symbols.

	<h2>Japanese sample text</h2>
	<p>Japanese is normally written using two kinds of characters:
	<ul>
		<li>kanji: There are around two thousand regularly used kanji.<br>
			Their pronunciation changes completely depending on context.<br>
			Each one generally has a "meaning" that is used in one or more
			words.<br>
			For example, the kanji 食 means "food" or "eat":
			<ul>
				<li><ruby>食<rt>ta</rt></ruby><ruby>べ<rt>be</rt></ruby><ruby>る<rt>ru</rt></ruby>:
					to eat
				<li><ruby>食<rt>shoku</rt></ruby><ruby>堂<rt>dou</rt></ruby>:
					cafeteria
			</ul>
		<li>kana: There are 50 kana symbols, in two forms (hiragana and
			katakana).<br>
			Individual kana are purely phonetic and do not mean anything; they
			have essentially fixed pronunciations.<br>
			Each kana represents a "syllable" combinining an initial consonant
			followed by a vowel.<br>
			For example, the hiragana ほ represents the sound "ho".
	</ul>

	<p>I see no practical way to encode kanji using only 14 letters, so I
		presume any cipher is purely phonetic.

	<p>Japanese can be "spelled" using these 50 kana. Below is a sample of
		Japanese text taken from the Nintendo website, and its conversion to
		kana.

	<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/zelda/totk/character/index.html">https://www.nintendo.co.jp/zelda/totk/character/index.html</a>

	<blockquote id="kana-sample">

	</blockquote>

	<p>Because there are only 14 zonai symbols, they could not possibly encode
		the 50 kana, like what was done in the Ocarina of Time script.

	<p>Instead, I suspect the Zonai script is more likely based on a proper
		alphabet, such as the transliteration of Japanese into the Latin
		alphabet.

	<p>There are several ways to transliterate Japanese text into the Latin
		alphabet (referred to as "romaji", for Roman-characters). Here are the
		choices I made for the below transliteration:

	<ul>
		<li>Grammatical particles are transliterated as they are written, not as
			they are pronounced<br>
			(so を is "wo" not "o" and は is "ha" not "wa")
		<li>Long vowels are transliterated as the two vowels<br>
			(so おう is "ou" not "o" or "oh" or "ō")
		<li>Irregularly pronounced consonants are spelled regularly<br>
			(so ち is "ti" rather than "chi", つ is "tu" rather than "tu",
			しゅ is "syu" rather than "shu", ふ is "hu" rather than "fu")
		<li>Small っ is written with a double consonant
			(so 救った is written "sukutta")
	</ul>

	<blockquote id="romaji-sample">
		<p>siro ha tyuu he to ukabiagari, sora kara nazo no iseki ga hurisosogu.
		hairaru ha totujo tosite, tenpentii ni mimawareta.
		syujinkou rinku ha, hatenaki bouken ni hutatabi mi wo toujiru.

		<p>katute hairaru wo sukutta yuusya.
			migite no tikara wo kusisite, hairaru no ihen ni tatimukau.

		<p>soumei de koukisin ousei na hairaru oukoku no himegimi.
			hairaru wo soutenpentii ni makikomaretesimau.

		<p>josei bakari no gerudozoku nioite,
			hyakunen ni itido dake umareru otokotosite sei wo ukeru.
			hairaru wo osotta tenpentii to nanika kankei ga aru you daga.
	</blockquote>

	<p>However, many of these features do not appear to be used by Zonai text.
	<ul>
		<li>Double letters are extremely rare, so it's unlikely 救った would be
			spelled as "sukutta", because the small っ is very common in
			Japanese.
		<li>Similarly, I removed double vowels like "ii" and "uu", but not
			"ou" or "ei".
		<li>Irregular spellings are not used, because there aren't enough
			letters to include a "c" for "chi" or "f" for "fu"
		<li>Voicing is probably not indicated, because there aren't enough
			letters to distinguish d and t, s and z and j, h and b and p,
			k and g, etc.
			<ul>
				<li>This is the case with the "Old Hylian" script from the
					Ocarina of Time.
			</ul>
		<li>I chose to transliterate "small kana" Y- sounds without the
			preceding "i", and "small tsu" the same as a regular "tu", so a
			string like キャット ("kyatto") would become "kyatuto".
	</ul>


	<p>Below is the result of these operations. This text is what is used to
		generate the unigram and bigram tables for Japanese romaji above.
